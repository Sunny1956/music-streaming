# Melodystream — Dark Themed Music Streaming Demo

This is a minimal full-stack demo (Melodystream) that serves static frontend files and exposes a small API to list songs.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start server:

```bash
npm start
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Notes
- Seeded sample tracks are provided in `data/songs.json` (these point to remote sample MP3s). Local files placed in `assets/songs/` will also be listed.
- Cover images can be placed in `assets/images/`.
